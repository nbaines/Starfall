# Starfall
This repository does not contain a built version of the game, it can be run in editor by opening in unreal (4.27), navigating to the main menu level if it is not open, and running play in ediitor.

Starfall was made by a team of 6 over the course of 2-3 months. It's a puzzle platforming game inspired by portal, which was created using Unreal Engine version 4.27. For my part, I worked on implementing and tweaking player movement from the initial unreal engine setting, as well as doing audio, lighting, and general bug testing and fixing.
